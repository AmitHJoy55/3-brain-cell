## Problem
Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to the effects of global warming. In recent years, we have experienced an alarming increase in the frequency of natural disasters. If this trend continues, our lives and assets will remain perpetually at risk.
This vulnerability is further aggravated by mismanagement in disaster response. Inefficient allocation of resources, lack of coordination among agencies, and inadequate early warning systems often leave communities unprepared and recovery efforts delayed. Without addressing these systemic issues, the impacts of natural disasters will only worsen.

## Proposed Solution
Effective disaster management during critical situations can significantly reduce the impact of any disasters. We propose a centralized system designed to coordinate and manage disaster response in an organized and efficient manner.  
Our platform will facilitate coordination among various volunteer organizations, streamline relief distribution, organize fund collection, and manage other essential activities needed to manage a disaster.

## Features
- Affected area mapping  
- Predictive disaster data  
- Relief distribution management  
- Fundraising and allocation  
- Volunteer organization coordination  
- Missing person list with criticality-based sorting
